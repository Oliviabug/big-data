    <section class='what'>
      <h1>WHAT IS ALGORITHMIC TRADING?</h1>

      <p>Robots are trading millions of stocks every millisecond, every day. Thanks to ever-advancing algorithms,
         machines buy and sell in worldwide financial markets at unimaginable speeds.</p>

      <p>Robotic trading has only grown in recent years. The most popular form of algorithmic trading,
         high-frequency trading (HFT), processes historical and real-time market data to know when to buy
         and sell at lightning speed.</p>

      <p>HFT trading volume grew by 164 percent between 2005 and 2009, according to the NYSE. And according
         to Bank of England, HFTs traded 70 percent of the average daily share volume in US equities.</p>

      <a href='https://plot.ly/~DieterHolger/26.embed'></a>

      <p>Thanks to big data, these algorithms are only becoming smarter at trading billions of dollars every day.
         The more and more data financial robots consume makes them even smarter at making quickest,<p>

      <blockquote><p>The industry is transforming into a big data business. It’s going to be firms that invest
         in the technology that will be leaders in the space.</p></br><span> - Ari Rubenstein, co-founder and chief executive at GTS,
            a high frequency trading company</span></blockquote>

      <h1>HOW DOES IT USE BIG DATA?</h1>


      <p>According to a <a href='https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/big-data/0/steps/7632'>study</a> from the University of Warwick, the more weekly searches a company has the more it’s traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
         But trading more of a company’s stock just because it comes up in searches has problems. What if people are searching about their exploding Samsung battery?</p>

      <p>This is where sentiment analysis comes in. Algorithms scrape the language millions of people use on Twitter and in Google searches, determining whether people are
         thinking positively or negatively about a company or product.</p>

         <div class='plotly'>
       <a href="https://plot.ly/~OliviaBugault/10/?share_key=t9GGvPR3eCv1Wwf3BS3g0f" target="_blank" title="Plot 10" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~OliviaBugault/10.png?share_key=t9GGvPR3eCv1Wwf3BS3g0f" alt="Plot 10" style="max-width: 100%;width: 600px;"  width="600" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>

        </div>


      <p>These algorithms also watch the sentiment of real-time news coverage. Bad press can trigger machines to sell stocks off in a flurry. And perceived events
         can affect how algorithms trade on the market as a whole.</p>

      <p>CNBC reported the <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/id/100666302'>“first real-time demonstration of robo-trading”</a> in 2013 when a hacked AP Twitter account said there were explosions at the White House.
         Computers abruptly ended trades faster than humans could</p>

      <blockquote><p> It's not so much that the computers initiated trades. What happened is that they canceled the orders, so the bids come out of the market. That causes a crash</p></br><span>A person at an algorithmic trading firm told CNBC.</span></blockquote>

    <section class='efficiency'>
      <h1>IS IT WORKING?</h1>

      <p>First, let’s highlight that algorithmic trading is not an attempt to make a trading profit. It is a way to minimize the cost, market impact and risk.
      </p>

      <p>They are widely used and successful because they replace human emotions by data analysis. By keeping emotions in check, traders more easily stick to plan.
      </p>

      <p>Backtesting is another advantage. It applies trading rules to historical market data to determine the viability of an idea. Traders can take these precise sets
         of rules and test them on historical data before risking money in live trading. The use of algo trading combined with big data minimize risks.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, they are controversial amongst others for their supposed role in flash crashes.</p>


      <div class='plotly'>
    <a href="https://plot.ly/~OliviaBugault/8/?share_key=KNnOlSWCon0C9uHKUwUSnq" target="_blank" title="Plot 8" style="display: block; text-align: center;"><img src="https://plot.ly/~OliviaBugault/8.png?share_key=KNnOlSWCon0C9uHKUwUSnq" alt="Plot 8" style="max-width: 100%;width: 600px;"  width="600" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';" /></a>

      <p>On May 6th 2010, the Dow Jones plummeted 1000 points within a single trading day. Nearly $1 trillion was wiped off the market value, as well as a drop of 600 points within a 5-minutes time frame, before recovering moments later. The SEC, CFTC and many experts largely blamed HFT firms for the crash.</p>


     <!-- <div class='crash'>
       <img src='flashcrash.png'>
     </div> -->

     <div class='explanation'>

       <p>HFT algorithms worsen the impact of the crash by increasing the price fluctuation this day. Constantly analysing the market, they noticed a decline in the stock market value and started to sell a vast amount of securities.

      <p>The future systems could study all the historical data that we have archived over the course of the entire trading history, analyze it with ease
         to find out the trends, what would work and what would not.</p>

      <p>Most importantly, with a constantly growing amount of data available, it could also teach itself to predict the future markets. </p>

      <p>Market crashes might become a thing of the past with trading become sentient and realizing the impact of a buy/sell gone wrong.</p>

      <p>Imagine a system so powerful, with a vast reach with Big Data and connectivity like the likes of the IoT rapid internet speed and gigaflops of processing power incorporating structured and unstructured data, utilizing real-time global news feed, with LIVE social media and current and historical stock data across the globe in one algorithmic engine.
      </p>

      <p>Moreover, a 2010 study from Bollen released that Twitter mood predicts the stock market with 86,7% accuracy. In the future, algo trading are gonna use more and more social media - which mean our personal data - to predict the market and buy or sell securities. </p>
